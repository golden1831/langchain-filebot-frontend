                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In legal terms, we are generally the ‘data controller’ under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a ‘data processor’ on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the ‘data controller’ responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers’ privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see ‘WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?’ above), in and other countries.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">expolab and the following entities and subsidiaries: Stripe comply with the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from Switzerland to the United States. Although Privacy Shield is no longer considered a valid transfer mechanism for the purposes of Swiss data protection law, in light of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-311/18 and opinion of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland dated 8 September 2020, expolab will continue to comply with the principles of the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. Learn more about the Privacy Shield program. To view our certification, please visit https://stripe.com/nl/legal/privacy-shield-policy.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">expolab adheres to and complies with the Privacy Shield Principles when processing personal information from Switzerland. If we have received your personal information in the United States and subsequently transfer that information to a third party acting as our agent, and such third party agent processes your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, we will remain liable unless we can prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, expolab is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission (‘FTC’). In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If you have any questions or concerns relating to expolab’s Privacy Shield certification, please write to us at the contact details below. We commit to resolving any complaints or disputes about our collection and use of your personal information under the Privacy Shield. However, if you have an unresolved complaint in connection with our certification, we commit to cooperating with the panel established by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, as applicable, and to comply with the advice given by them in respect of the complaint. See the following list of EU DPAs.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In limited situations, Swiss individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Please be sure to review the following sections of this Privacy Notice for additional details relevant to expolab’s participation in the Swiss-US Privacy Shield:</p>

                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION? To learn more about the purposes for which expolab collects and uses personal information about you.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? To learn more about the type or identity of third parties to which expolab discloses personal information, and the purposes for which we do so.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS? To learn more about the right of individuals to access their personal data.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">10. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at contact@chatbot.ai.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section ‘HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?’ below.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section ‘HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?’ below or updating your preferences.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section ‘HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?’ below.

                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.

                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
                <p className="mb-[0.9rem]">We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification.
