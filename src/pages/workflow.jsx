                  Looking for a GPT chatbot that works with your own content? Filebot is a website that helps you create a chatbot that can answer questions. With your own PDFâ€™s as the source! To create the chatbot, you can upload text documents or provide text for the chatbot to learn from. The text will be processed and analyzed so that the chatbot can accurately pick up the information. Once the chatbot is created, you can embed it on your website to enhance the user experience.

                <Typography className="mb-5 font-normal">
                  The chatbot will only answer questions based on the provided data, but you can change this if you want. At the moment, Filebot supports plain text and pdf formats. You can easily add the chatbot to your website by allowing public access and including a provided script.

                <Typography className="font-normal">
                  The chatbot can understand and help in over 50 different languages. When you ask a question, it will try its best to give you an answer in the language you asked, even if the text is written in a different language.
